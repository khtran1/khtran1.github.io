# About

Hi! I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. With a strong passion for software development and data science, I've been captivated by the art of coding, algorithmic problem-solving, and the potential for artificial intelligence and machine learning to revolutionize industries. 

I am currently open to full-time or internship positions in software or data engineering. My professional experience deals with financial data and markets, but I have interests in many other fields of software and data engineering, from biotech to hardware. Outside of work and school, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and dreaming of travelling the world!

For more information, you can find my CV [here](/cv) or reach out at my contact information above!
