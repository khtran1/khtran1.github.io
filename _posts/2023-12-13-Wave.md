# What is Wave?
---

Wave is a mobile app developed with the Flutter framework built by Google for Android and iOS development. It was built by me and three other teammates over the course of 10 weeks from September 2023 to December 2023 as part of a mobile development course at UCSB (CS 184).

The premise is simple: Users wishing to find other people to do things with can express their 
intent to do something on a certain day at a certain time, and other users can express their 
interest in joining them. 

Over the course of the quarter, we worked with Agile methodologies to get a prototype up and running by Week 5, and polished the app over the last 5 weeks.

i made these expandable/swipable cards that was pretty cool

less cool, but i also set up the Firebase services that we used for databases and authentication, here's what was written as part of the documentation for the project:

### System Architecture Overview
---
When a user registers an account, their user details are stored in the Firestore Database and their credentials are handled by Firebase Authentication.

The user is able to create, edit, and delete posts. After creating a post, the post appears in the View Events tab and is available to be viewed by all users. A post created by a user can only be deleted by the user and those with admin privileges. Once a post is created, it is stored in the Firestore Database. If an image is uploaded by the user, it is stored in the Firestore Storage.

When the user navigates to the View Events tab, they can choose to accept an event. If they do so, it is added to the list of events they are attending on the Home Page under User Info. This is stored in the Firestore Database.
